NodeBox 2
=========
NodeBox is a new software application for creating generative art using 
procedural graphics and a new way to approach graphic design.

NodeBox is:
- Node based -- the software uses a non-destructive workflow where every operation 
  is represented by a visual block of code.
- Open Source -- NodeBox is completely free to use and extend under the GPL license.
- Python -- Nodes are written in the popular dynamic programming language.
